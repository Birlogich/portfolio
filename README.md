My personal website.
I created this web application to show a little part of my skills. This app works on React.JS.
For browsing pages I used React-Router-Dom with its features like Outlet and Layout.
For Comments I used Redux-React and Redux-Persist which helped me save state and change it. It means if you reload the page,
information won't remove. For toggle dark and light theme I used the same technologies.
To save my code light I used Tailwind CSS to avoid creating many files for styles.
For some features like Slider Carousel I used conditional render with my own custom hook.
Tech Stack - HTML, Tailwind CSS, React.JS, Redux-React, React-Router-Dom, Redux Toolkit. Material UI, React Icons.
